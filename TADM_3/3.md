## We have seen how dynamic arrays enable arrays to grow while still achieving constant-time amortized performance. This problem concerns extending dynamic arrays to let them both grow and shrink on demand.

### (a) Consider an underflow strategy that cuts the array size in half whenever the array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost.

**Solution**
Poor performance occurs when the array is at half capacity and then items are appended and popped in alternativing order.
This cause the array to resize on every insert and removal, giving bad amortized cost.

### (b) Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that achieves constant amortized cost per deletion.

**Solution**
Shrink in alternate scale. i.e 1/4 instead of 1/2. This gives more buffer space for inserts and prevents the reallocation.
