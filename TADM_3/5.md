## Find the overhead fraction (the ratio of data space over total space) for each of the following binary tree implementations on n nodes:

### (a) All nodes store data, two child pointers, and a parent pointer. The data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires four bytes.

**Solution**
data = 4 bytes
total = 16 bytes (3 pointers = 12 bytes)
4 / 16 = 0.25

### (b) Only leaf nodes store data; internal nodes store two child pointers. The data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires two bytes.

**Solution**
data = n * 4
total = n * 4 + 4*(n-1)
n * 4 /  (n * 4 + 4*(n-1)) = n/2n - 1
take limit -> infinity = infinity / 2 infitiy  = 1/2
