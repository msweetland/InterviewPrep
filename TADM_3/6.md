## Describe how to modify any balanced tree data structure such that search, insert, delete, minimum, and maximum still take O(logn) time each, but successor and predecessor now take O(1) time each. Which operations have to be modified to support this?

**Solution**
### Add a reference between nodes. For successor and predecessor

search = O(log(n)) returns node

Since we have not we can use the linked list to get to the successor or predecessor in O(1)

insert and delte will still take O(log(n)) time, but must be modified to track and delte the predecessor/successor pointer at each recursive step.
