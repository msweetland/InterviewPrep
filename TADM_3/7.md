## Suppose you have access to a balanced dictionary data structure, which supports each of the operations search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, successor, and predecessor in O(logn) time. Explain how to modify the insert and delete operations so they still take O(logn) but now minimum and maximum take O(1) time. (Hint: think in terms of using the abstract dictionary operations, instead of mucking about with pointers and the like.)

**Solution**
Store min and max on insert and delete.
