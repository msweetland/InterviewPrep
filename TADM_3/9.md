###  A concatenate operation takes two sets S1 and S2, where every key in S1 is smaller than any key in S2, and merges them together. Give an algorithm to concatenate two binary search trees into one binary search tree. The worst-case running time should be O(h), where h is the maximal height of the two trees.

**Solution**
Set left pointer in the left most leaf in S2 to S1.
